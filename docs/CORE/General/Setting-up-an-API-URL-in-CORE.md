The Simova API is used for handling functionalities for the Simova extensions which are outside the BC system. In some cases it makes sense to change the API URL (In case of eg an own API installation).

##**How to change the API URL**
After the provision of another API URL, the following steps are needed to use the API in the BC system/Simova CORE. 
- Go to the Module Setup of your installed product
- Click on "License"
- Click on "Setup"
- Enter the API URI

:information_source: The API URI must belong to an instance of "API by Simova"
