For the file preview it can happen that the file is too large and therefore a too long request to the simova api is generated.
For this reason, it is possible to specify a maximum file size for the file preview.

#Setting up maximum file size
To set the maximum file size, the following steps must be performed:
1. Choose the ![image](/Setting-up-DMS-by-Simova/search_small.png) icon, enter ***DMS - Module Setup*** or navigate via role center to the action Setup and then execute the action General
2. Now navigate to ***Preview Maximum File Size (MB)*** in the general settings
3. Specify the maximum size of the file in MB for the preview
4. Save and close
