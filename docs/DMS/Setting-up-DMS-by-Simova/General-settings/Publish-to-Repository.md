The setup needs to be transferred to the repository once the setup has been imported via the configuration wizard and the repository has been configured.

# Publish to repository
The following steps need to be completed to publish the configuration to the repository.

1. We start in the _**DMS by Simova - Administrator**_ role.
2. Click on _**Setup**_ in the ribbon bar and execute the action _**General**_.
3. Execute the action _**Publish to Repository**_.
4. The transfer process is started and can take some time depending on the size of the setup.

> :warning: The transfer of the setup to SharePoint is done via the API by Simova. The connection to the API and to the SharePoint site must be ensured.

All metadata, content types and document libraries should be marked with the status Published as a result when the publication process is completed.
