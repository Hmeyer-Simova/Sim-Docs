DMS by Simova uses the email templates for the automatically email notification by creating a reminder for customers.

# Email template setup
In order to import the email templates, the following steps must be taken:
1. Choose the ![image](/Setting-up-DMS-by-Simova/search_small.png) icon, enter ***DMS - Email templates*** 
2. Select a line and navigate to the ***Import*** action
3. Choose the Html email template from the file system
4. Save and close

It is possible to edit email templates directly in Business Central using the HTML editor which is located on the ***Email Template*** page.
- This is a "what you see is what you get" editor. This means that you can edit the email template in the normal view and still get a correct .HTM file.
