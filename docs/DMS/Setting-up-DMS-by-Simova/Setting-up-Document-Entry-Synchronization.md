Document libraries represent the storage location of documents. It may happen that files and documents are stored directly in SharePoint. A synchronisation is necessary so that these files and documents are also displayed and listed in DMS by Simova. This can also be done automatically by using a job queue entry.

2. Click on _**Repository**_ in the ribbon bar and execute the action _**Document Libraries**_.
3. Click on the document library _**Code**_ that should be configured with the default mapping.
