Your administrator can set up one or more sandbox accounts alongside your production environment, even if you’ve signed up for a trial. No data is transferred from any of the sandbox accounts to your production environment, so playing around with sandbox data is completely risk-free.

To get started with sandboxes, please contact your existing Business Central partner. For more information, see Finding a Reseller of DMS by Simova.
