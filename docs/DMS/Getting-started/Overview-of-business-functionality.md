In this benchmark it can be seen that the Business Central standard is always evolving with new functionalities, but compared to special extensions, such as DMS, it does not offer the full range of functions. Extensions to the standard functionalities created precisely for the tasks will usually always offer more possibilities than the standard offered by Microsoft.

Whether the standard is sufficient for a company or whether the functional enhancements of the DMS solution offer a company considerable added value can only be said precisely after an individual examination. In general, however, the use of a DMS can significantly reduce the time spent searching for and finding documents. A report by McKinsey states that employees spend an average of 1.8 hours a day searching for and collecting information. That equates to 9.3 hours per week.

# Storing documents in BC
Both in Business Central Standard and with DMS by Simova you can store documents directly in BC.

# Document relations
The standard of Business Central and DMS by Simova allow documents to be filed directly to a document, such as a sales quotation or a sales order. The documents can be viewed directly when viewing the respective document. The stored documents are included when a transaction is posted and are also available there.

# Basic Metadata (Uploading User, Date/Time)
When storing documents in Business Central, metadata is assigned to the file in both BC Standard and DMS. In BC Standard, however, this metadata is limited to the user who uploaded the document and the date and time of the upload.

# Factbox integration 
Both offer the possibility to store documents via a factbox for the respective document. The factbox is accessible from the document itself as well as from the list view.

# Different file extensions
Different documents, such as Word documents, Excel lists or PDF files can be stored in DMS by Simova and in BC Standard.

# Classification through extensive metadata & content types
DMS by Simova offers the user the possibility to classify the stored documents, i.e. a document type and further metadata is assigned to the document, which makes it easier for the user to find the documents again. In the BC standard no content types are assigned.

# Document search by file name, metadata, etc.
The „DMS | Document Search“ allows a detailed search for all documents and files stored in the system. It is possible to search and filter by metadata, content types, file names and many other criteria.

# Revision security through technology partner tools ecspand & SharePoint Online
By using tools of our technology partner d.velop and the functionalities of the SharePoint solution, the revision security of the documents in the DMS can be ensured. In this way, different compliance requirements can be met.

# Connection of different repositories
Being able to use different repositories is one of the main advantages of DMS by SImova in contrast to the BC standard. We recommend storing the documents in a SharePoint. File systems, database and third-party document management systems can also be connected.

# Storage via Drag & Drop
The Simova DMS Factbox allows documents to be easily filed by drag&drop. This feature makes the DMS by Simova very intuitive and user-friendly. Alternatively, a window can be opened to browse the file system.  

# Automatic archiving of generated reports & receipts via shadow printing
When posting documents, the reports can be automatically stored in the background by the so-called shadow printing in the DMS by Simova and are thus available to every user.

# Document preview for many formats integrated directly in BC (Word, Excel, PDF, image files, etc.)
In the document overview, which clearly displays all documents stored for a document, such as a sales quotation or a sales order, a document preview is integrated directly in Business Central. This allows the user to take a look at the documents without having to leave the BC interface. The common standard formats can all be displayed in the preview.

# Document versioning
Compared to the BC Standard, the DMS by Simova solution offers a versioning function. If a document is stored with the same name as an existing document, the user can choose whether the document should be versioned or stored under a different name. The previous versions are still available in the document overview.

# Barcode return through Barcode Split Service
Through the Barcode Split Service, documents that are labeled with a special barcode can be directly and automatically returned to the corresponding process in Busienss Central. The barcode labels are generated directly in Business Central via another DMS barcode factbox and can be applied to the reports.

# Dynamic metadata mapping
Dynamic mappings allow documents to be displayed retrospectively on previous processes or documents.

# Allowed file extensions can be defined by yourself
An administrator can define the possible file extensions that may be stored in the DMS system. This ensures that only relevant files and documents are stored in the DMS.

# Roles & rights system
Through a sophisticated roles & rights system, certain users or user groups can be given specific rights in the system. Access to certain documents or entire content types can be regulated in this way.

# Connector to other Simova solutions (e.g. EDS and DPS)
DMS by SImova offers the possibility to transfer the stored documents to other Simova extensions, such as EDS or DPS. In this way, documents can be sent directly from the DMS with EDS or displayed in a customer portal with DPS.
