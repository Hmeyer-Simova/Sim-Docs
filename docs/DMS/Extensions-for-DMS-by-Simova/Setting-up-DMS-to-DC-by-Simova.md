DMS by Simova comes with a standard configuration that covers all common scenarios and processes, but you can change the configuration to fit the exact needs of your organization.


The following documentation describes how to store documents that have been received via Document Capture.

# Setup
1. Open the DMS Module Setup
2. Go to the tab "DMS to DC" and expand it if this is not the case.
3. Activate the DMS to DC integration
4. Select whether the documents should be uploaded to the DMS by SImova when registering or when posting

#Document type configuration
Now it is possible to configure the different document types. 
1. Activate the document type you want to upload in DMS by Simova
2. Select with which content type the documents should be uploaded. It is distinguished whether the documents are received as an invoice or as a credit memo
3. Activate the cleanup of the document capture blobs if you want the documents to be available only in DMS by Simova after registration/posting

> :information_source: You can also use the same content types for invoice or credit memo
