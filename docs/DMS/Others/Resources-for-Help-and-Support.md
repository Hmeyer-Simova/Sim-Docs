You can always find help if you’re stuck, unable to find or understand something, or need assistance in other matters. In any such cases, feel free to use one of Simova’s three overall types of support, depending on your situation:

- Simova Docs (this site) – the official Simova documentation site
- Customer support – the place to go for end users
- Partner support – help and documentation exclusively for partners

# Simova Docs
Simova’s official documentation site, Simova Docs, features a large number of helpful articles for beginners, IT professionals and anyone in between. Always consult this site before resorting to any other support options!

# Customer support
As a customer, please contact your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central partner for any questions you might have about Document Capture – unless of course you can find the answers here on Simova Docs. Your partner has access to Simova training and a wealth of other relevant resources, and partners can also always contact Simova directly with specific queries, if necessary.

For more information, see Resellers and Partners and Finding a Reseller of DMS by Simova.

# Partner support
As a partner, you can get help by contacting Simova via the Simova Zone or the Simova website. The Simova Zone also contains a large number of educational resources that you may find useful, including video guides and the official Simova Help Center. These resources are specifically aimed at partners and contain much information that can’t be found elsewhere.

For any urgent inquiries or matters requiring immediate attention, please call or write our emergency hotline:

Mail: support@simova.de
Phone: +49 231 31776 448
Office hours: Monday to Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. CET

For more information, see Resellers and Partners and Becoming a Reseller of DMS by Simova.

**Note:** Only partners have access to the Simova Zone and the emergency hotline. As an end user, you’ll have to contact your existing Business Central partner for any queries that you can’t find answers to on Simova Docs.
