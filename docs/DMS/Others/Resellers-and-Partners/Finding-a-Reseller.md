To deliver the best possible service to you and all other users of Simova software, all Simova apps are sold, implemented and supported by a large network of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central partners. These partners are highly specialized in and knowledgeable about DMS by Simova and Business Central in general and will be able to get you up and running in the blink of an eye. Simply reach out to your partner to get started straightaway!

As an end user, you should generally always contact your dedicated partner if you need help with anything and can’t find what you’re looking for anywhere on Simova Docs (this site). Your partner is typically the same partner as the one that helps and supports you with matters relating to Business Central in general. If you like, your partner can also help you with a free 30-day trial or even set up one or more sandbox environments for you. For more information, see DMS by Simova Trials and Subscriptions.

You can get an overview of all Microsoft partners [here](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-en/marketplace/partner-dir). Simply enter your location, your organization size, and a relevant search phrase (such as “**Simova**” or “**DMS by Simova**”).
