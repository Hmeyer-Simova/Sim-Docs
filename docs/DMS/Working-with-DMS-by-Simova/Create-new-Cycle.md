Metadata represent the attributes of documents and are assigned to content types. Metadata need to be created before content types are created. There are different types of metadata that DMS by Simova supports. Text, Integer, Boolean, DateTime, Number and GUID can be selected as the type. The type defines the input option of values for the metadata.
