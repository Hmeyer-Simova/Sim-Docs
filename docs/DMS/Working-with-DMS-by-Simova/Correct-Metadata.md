If it ever happened that metadata of stored documents was not saved in Business Central or SharePoint, it can be corrected/recreated using the Correct Metadata feature.

This function only recreates metadata for documents that do not have a value in a metadata field.

# Recreate Metadata
1. We start in the _**DMS by Simova - Administrator**_ role.
2. Open the page _**Simova Apps | DMS Module Setup**_
3. Execute the action **Correct Metadata** in the ribbon bar.
4. **Confirm** the message if you are sure that this report should be started.
5. Now you have to enter a start and an end date. In this rage, all associated document entries are now checked whether the metadata should be corrected for them.
6. Now you need to specify the type of metadata correction. Document entry only: Only the documents in Business Central will be corrected. Include SharePoint metadata values: Business Central and the SharePoint document will be corrected.
7. After confirming the process begins. This can take **_longer_** depending on how much metadata needs to be corrected.
